# This project was created for an online hackathon by findcoder.io

## Problem is that I got to know about this ongoing  hackathon just 2 days before the deadline. So I had to create this project in 2 days

> Idk why I am writing this in readme. I am just trying to make it look good.
> Man this copilot
> Sometimes its good and others it does shit like the lines above

So really I got to know of it 2 days before and naturally I couldn't finish in time so I'm just uploading whatever I was able to come up with

## The reason why this behaves like mobile even on desktop is because I was too lazy to make it responsive (I know I know). That last part was copilot. Can't believe I'm playing with an AI. Gotta meet some real people

The real reason is because I wanted to make a mobile app and I didnt know how so I thought maybe I'll convert this into a PWA now only god knows what'll happen. ‚úåüèª

## So I missed the submit window by 9 minutes fk me. Now this is a personal project. Lets see when do I finish it

## What I learned so far

- I learned how to use react router
- Learned about using mongodb atlas, mongoose with react
- Learned about authentication
- Still trying to figure out the ProtectedRoute stuff

I'm just gonna build my way through this project without ProtectedRoute for now and then I'll add it later.
Also will be skipping any unnecessary styling for now.

Send some cool free t-shirts and ffs get me some friends to build projects with. I'm so lonely. I swear that last line was added by copilot. I didn't write that. I swear. Man this AI cant even figure out my own writing üíÄ
Seriously tho its so frustrating trying to figure out everything yourself.

Anywho
bye bye
